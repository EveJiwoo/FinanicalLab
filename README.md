# Finanical Lab

Fi-lab is created by group of high school students concerned about lack of financial education in school. Fi-lab wants students to engage early in financial education through the game and help make better decisions in real life. Students contribute with their talents and my role was develop financial concept and apply in Unity. 

When we tried to apply the concept of savings into the game, we wanted to make a variable interest rate. To apply this, we were challenged on how to provide this variable rate. So we started to study CPI, inflation, base rate and how banks set their interest rates.
